# get glados to say hello world, save it to a .wav file and resample the file to 8-bit 8khz
# curl -L --retry 30 --get --fail --data-urlencode "text=Hello World!" -o "hello_world.wav" "https://glados.c-net.org/generate"
# ffmpeg -i hello_world.wav -ar 8000 -ac 1 -acodec pcm_u8 output.wav

# needed processing
# 1. normalize the audio to 0db (full volume)
# 2. decimate to 8khz
# 3. reduce to 8-bit mono
# 4. Perhaps create raw files (no wav data)
